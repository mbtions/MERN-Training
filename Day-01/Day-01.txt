Q. why "index.html" is named?

Tag for HTML.
<html>   // opening Tag
    
    [content]

</html>  // closing Tag

Head
<head></head>  => All processing inside head such as meta, link, script, etc.

Body
<body></body>  => All content of the page goes inside body tag.

Refer to the websites for HTML:
- mdn.docs
- w3schools

Q. what happens when you type a url in a browser?

Semantic Tags for what purpose? 
=> To help the browser to understand the page content better.
=> for screen readers to interpret whats there on the page.

Example: 
1=>header tag
<header></header>

2=>footer Tag
<footer></footer>

3=>main Tag => Main content goes here!
<main></main>

=> Inside main
heading Tags:
<h1> </h1> ..... <h6> </h6>

Q. size(h6) < size(p) why??

Comments in HTML:
<!-- 
  ...
-->

if <paragraph> or not then gives it default behaviour of P tag.

meta: 
additional information to your webpage.

b vs strong tag
b => bold
strong => bold with effects.

Example in mobile which have bold text bydefault will show more 
boldness in case of strong tag and not in b tag.

em vs i tag

u vs ins
ins: insert tag that shows data which is inserted.

ins and del are used together to show updation.

s: strikethrough 

italic + bold =>  nesting of i and b

Q. why aside? 
=> for ads not to be associated with the main page for its content. (for better SEO optimization)

link tag
<a> anchor

<a href="/home">Home</a> : Relative url
this link "/home" is a relative url that is it is [origin]/home


origin: DNS of a website
http or https: directs you to change the origin, if not included then it will not navigate to the cross origin url.

if ://www.google.com then also behaves same.
similarly: h://url

image tag:
<img>
why nor requirement of closing tag? => Since there is no content in these tags therefore
do not require closing tag.

inline elements vs block elements

NOTE: Not mandatory to write in double quotes.

Q. xhtml vs html
