Q. array methods
Q. callback 

shift deletes

reduce, filter, map, splice, slice.

Q. forEach vs Map?

Q. String methods
=> trim method to trim white spaces

* Asynchronous JavaScript *

If you want to run a function after 10 minutes, we use setTimeOut but then just after 10 minutes it takes some time to process and ready the execution.

JavaScript is a single-threaded language.
A process has multiple threads and has atleast a single thread that is called main thread.

Callstack waits for none and executes immediately
then how to execute a certain code after a particular interval?

setTimeout(fn, time);

same thing as with setTimeout happens with event handlers

browser has PP + button id and all other details

addEventListener(event-type, callback-fn)

forEach callback can execute immediately, (synchronous callback)

Event handlers callbacks are asynchronous callbacks.

* FETCH *

req.then or direct code.then or fetch.then

Q. what is body: (...) in response?
body: (...) or body: ReadableStream
ReadableStream is in packets form

// then also returns some data

can we store the data somewhere else and console just when data received.

who handles promise?

fetch promise is handled by browser.

JavaScript is just a Callstack

// 426 upgrade required error

* ARRAY *
shift() removes from index 0
unshift() adds at index 0

using delete() leaves undefined hole.

we can merfe two arrays using concatenation
arr1.concat(arr2) for two arrays
arr1.concat(arr2, arr3) for three arrays
