Q. setInterval, clearInterval, etc

EventLoop
=> To push async tasks or parts into stack

waiting areas for async tasks => 
1. MicroTask Queue (High Priority) => Has code for promises or fetch
2. Callback Queue (Low Priority)

Can we create own promises? => Yes

* Inversion of Control *
control has been given to other.
Example, makePayment control is given to createOrder to execute.
there is no guarantee that makePayment will actually be called, or will be called only once.
