selectors:
1. Tag selectors      (tagName)
2. Id selectors       (#idName)
3. Class selectors    (.className)

Cases:
heading-two:    kabab-Case  (CSS)
heading_two:    snake_Case  (python)

BoxModel:
=> Content
=> Margin
=> Padding
=> Border

Width is given to content.

box-sizing =>
border-box (wrt border)
content-box (wrt content)

Q. PPI vs DPI

Q. Logical vs Physical Pixel.

Industry used border-box by default.

width = border(l&r)+content+padding
Q. write the same for height.

centering a div
1. Content centering by text-align property.
2. Margin:auto and width


center

CSS units:
[Absolute]
=> pixel(px) 1/96 
[Relative]
=> root element's font-size (rem) 
=> element's font-size (em)

The root element's font-size is rem

em=> (relative to its immediate parent)
font-size: em will be relative to its parent. 
parent =10 px => child => 20px for 2em

other than font-size it will depend on itself only for relativity.
ex: width relative to its font-size.


rem => (relative to its root element i.e. html tag)


depend

mostly use for the rem since it has more usability.

Use cases for em unit:
1. when want to design same element of similar configurations but somewhere small, somewhere big,  somewhere normal.
relativity. (dynamic design)
