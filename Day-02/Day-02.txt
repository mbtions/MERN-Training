AScII length : 128 characters
UTF-8: Extended ASCII length: 256 characters

screen readers when sent text capitalised through css helps in proper reading.

Inline CSS has highest priority and cannot be cached.

Internal CSS
selectors:
1. Tag selectors      (tagName)
2. Id selectors       (#idName)
3. Class selectors    (.className)
4. Universal selector (*)
5. Combinator selectors (>, +(sibling), ~)

Cases:
heading-two:    kabab-Case  (CSS)
heading_two:    snake_Case  (python)
headingTwo:     camelCase   (javascript)
HeadingTwo:     PascalCase  (React)

BoxModel:
=> Content
=> Margin
=> Padding
=> Border

Width is given to content.

box-sizing =>
border-box (wrt border)
content-box (wrt content)

Q. PPI vs DPI

Q. Logical vs Physical Pixel.

Industry used border-box by default.

width = border(l&r)+content+padding
Q. write the same for height.

centering a div
1. Content centering by text-align property.
2. Margin:auto and width


center

CSS units:
[Absolute]
=> pixel(px) 1/96 
[Relative]
=> root element's font-size (rem) 
=> element's font-size (em)

The root element's font-size is rem

em=> (relative to its immediate parent)
font-size: em will be relative to its parent. 
parent =10 px => child => 20px for 2em

other than font-size it will depend on itself only for relativity.
ex: width relative to its font-size.


rem => (relative to its root element i.e. html tag)


depend

mostly use for the rem since it has more usability.

Use cases for em unit:
1. when want to design same element of similar configurations but somewhere small, somewhere big,  somewhere normal.
relativity. (dynamic design)

Viewport:
vh viewport height
vw viewport width

max vh: 100vh
min vh 0vh
same goes for the vw

vmin: (overflow)
Useful when content overflows, then the given or assigned value is considered minimum

vmax: (underflow)


overflow: Hidden or scroll etc


:hover, :visited, :first-child,
:last-child
are
pseudo-classes

::
are pseudo-elements

nth-child is a pseudo-class.

tagName:nth-child(k)  read as kth child which is the given or selected "tagName" tag element.

nth-of-type() => to select nth element of some type.

parent > direct child
