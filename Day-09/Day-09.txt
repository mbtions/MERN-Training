Search Functionality achieved.

PUT => Complete details replacement
PATCH => specific detail replacement

why /api/products ? and not /products only?

To get all the products

TYPE: http://localhost:5500/api/products in POSTMAN

hit SEND button
get the data inside the output window

form data from frontend to backend is POST method.

action="[POST method]"
data in body and not in query, therefore we use POST method.
As password in URL is not a good practice. (one of the methods)

second method=> body method

body > raw + JSON
write some JSON inside and hit SEND in POSTMAN for POST


write things in data

// variables in params
// query in questions

// filter 
// slice
// flatmap


PROBLEMS
1. Whatif someone sends id which does not exists
2. ID not exists
3. Cannot post for unknown positions
4. Compulsory data can be skipped, example price (data validation)
5. 

middleware
router

architecture of JS is of type of a middleware.
app.get is also a middleware

if same name two routes, then there must be error

body parser

everything is middleware in JS
