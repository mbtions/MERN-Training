In Async Await, you can write try catch in place of .catch().

If a website blocks, then it may have async await.

Multiple buttons, with onclick, 

blocking, non-blocking behaviours.


object through array: using reduce
flatMap, map, flat in array

flatMap => filter + map

replace function

Module is nothing but a code.

Main File System API are: 
=> Promises API
=> Callback API
=> Synchronous API

Data packets in buffer:
to reduce load on server and to reduce waiting time of the user.

// This data is in buffer because data is received in packets.

converting packets to text form:
=> toString() function
=> or tell while reading the file using encoding => in [Options] parameter of the function
=> {encoding: 'utf8'}

For a RAM of 8KB, 12 GB data can be processed efficiently using buffer, that is why we  use buffer to read or write or load data.

Even though time exceeds using buffer.

readFileSync has blocking behaviour.

File System through:
=> Synchronous
    readFileSync() from fs
=> Callback 
    readFile() from fs
=> Promises 
    readFile() from fs/promises

Q. URI vs URL

142.250.194.110 is the IP for google.

DNS => fro picking IP address and map it with the domain.

we use http to create server for our website.

server has request and response.
createServer(request, response)

request.url will return the url that you would have on your server.

package nodemon is used to reload itself again the server

$> npm i -d nodemon 
=> used to include in devDependencies rather than dependencies.
Q. what is the benefit?

Now write to run the server =>
nodeman [FileName]
